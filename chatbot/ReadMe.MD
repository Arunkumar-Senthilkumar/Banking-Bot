Implementation of a Contextual Chatbot in PyTorch.
Simple chatbot implementation with PyTorch.

We aim to develop an AI-powered chatbot for a Web Banking application that enhances customer service in the banking sector.
This chatbot will leverage artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries effectively, providing a seamless and efficient banking experience.
The goal is to create a user-friendly and responsive interface that allows customers to interact with the bank's services in a conversational manner.

We are still in work for improving the intents.
